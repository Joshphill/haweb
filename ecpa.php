                        ECPA is our bespoke Continuous Payment Authority service. It is totally unique to the industry. 
                        Why? Because it allows you to not only specify the day of week/month you want to take a payment,
                        but also the time of day. Meaning you have complete flexibility over when (and how) you take your
                        payments. No more seeing "insufficient funds" a day after the payment is scheduled to be taken
                        from the customer.
